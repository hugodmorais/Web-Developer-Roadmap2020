Quick Note: SSH Into A Server
In the previous video I showed you how to add SSH keys to the authorized_keys  
of a Digital Ocean Server. Afterwards, I also showed you how to add it on the Digital 
Ocean control panel. Keep in mind that you cannot, use the control panel in Digital Ocean 
to add keys to already created droplets. You either have to create a new server after 
you've added the SSH key on the control panel, or add it manually to the authorized_keys 

Also, if you are on Windows, you may have to use GitBash instead of Powershell. Here are 
the steps that a fellow student followed:

1. Download, install and open Git Bash - the link is provided at the end of the video.

2. Type "ssh-agent bash" and press Enter.

3. Type "ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_digitalocean" and press Enter. You should get confrimation of 
Identity added.

4. Try connecting to your digital ocean account again via SSH. Now it shouldn't ask you for 
the password!

Recommended ssh-keygen  command:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
